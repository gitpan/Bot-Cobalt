## Plugin::WWW config
## 
## The 'WWW' plugin handles asynchronous HTTP for Web-enabled plugins.
## You probably want this loaded, else some plugins may silently fail.
##
## For most configurations, the defaults here should be fine.

Opts:
  ## The 'MaxWorkers' opt is misleadingly named.
  ##
  ## Previously this plugin forked off LWP::UserAgent instances.
  ## Now it uses POE::Component::Client::HTTP.
  ## Rather than throttling the number of forked workers, now this 
  ## opt controls how many concurrent requests are allowed to be issued.
  ##
  ## Defaults to 25.
  MaxWorkers: 25

  ## A local IP to bind to for outgoing connections.
  ## (Default uses INADDR_ANY)
  BindAddr: ~

  ## A HTTP proxy to use, in the form of ADDRESS:PORT
  ##  f.ex some.http.proxy:8080
  Proxy: ~

  ## HTTP request timeout. Defaults to 90 seconds.
  Timeout: 90
