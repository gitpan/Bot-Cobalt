## cobalt2 Plugin::RDB configuration
##
## The RDB plugin provides flexible methods for randomizing responses.

Opts:
  ## RDBs live in Bot::Cobalt::DB files, typically in their own directory.
  ## By default, they're placed in Cobalt's var/db/rdb/
  ## This should be a directory relative to our var/ :
  RDBDir: 'db/rdb'

  ## Whether or not to allow complete deletion of RDBs
  ## (BOOLEAN, default false)
  AllowDelete: 0

  ## Whether or not to allow deletion of the main RDB
  ## Overrides AllowDelete
  ## Set to an access level to enable for that level.
  AllowDeleteMain: 0

  ## Delay at which we should broadcast random stuff out of 'main'
  ## Will send to any channels not marked as 'rdb_randstuffs: 0' in 
  ## channels.conf
  ## Should be a timestr such as '20m' or '1h30m' or even '1h5m10s'
  ## Set to 0 to disable timed 'random stuff' altogether
  RandDelay: '30m'
  
  ## AsyncSearch will use forking asynchronous workers to run deep 
  ## searches against RDBs; unless your RDBs are very large, this is 
  ## very possibly more overhead than it is worth.
  ##
  ## Enabled if boolean true; if greater than 1, it is taken as the 
  ## maximum number of concurrent search workers.
  ##
  ## Don't bother on Win32 -- Windows doesn't have a proper fork(),
  ## and the overhead probably sucks.
  AsyncSearch: 0
  
  ## By default, RDB::SearchCache will store up to 30 searches per RDB.
  ## For a very large database, you may want to store more search 
  ## results in memory:
  #CacheItems: 30

## Levels required to execute various commands.
RequiredLevels:
  rdb_info: 0
  rdb_search: 0
  rdb_add_item: 1
  rdb_del_item: 3
  rdb_create: 3
  rdb_delete: 9999
