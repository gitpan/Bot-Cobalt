# Bot::Cobalt Changes

* 0.006  (05 Jun 2012)

  Fix instance rc files:
    - Kill old-style rcfiles, use YAML like other confs
    - Allow absolute 'BASE' path to be passed in
    - Default to cwd() if not absolute and home directory not available
    - Create portable paths (File::Spec)
  This is an incompatible change; issue an informative error and 
  suggest running `cobalt2-installer` on failure.

  Add Plugin::Extras::CPAN, a simplistic MetaCPAN and Module::CoreList 
  querying plugin.

  Add debug opt to Bot::Cobalt::Conf constructor. Pass our --debug value 
  to Conf as well (in bin/cobalt2 and Plugin::Rehash).

  Bot::Cobalt::Serializer should complain when freeze() or thaw() are 
  given no data.

  Improved ::Core log object handling. Create initial log object at 
  construction-time (not Syndicator start time) and ensure that 
  replacement log objects can handle log methods in use in the core set.
  
  Use Try::Tiny in place of previous block evals and $@ checks.

  Depend on newer POE::Component::Client::HTTP and 
  POE::Component::Resolver. Systems with older Components that happened 
  to grab newer Socket::GetAddrInfo would produce failures due to 
  Socket::GetAddrInfo API changes -- newer POE bits make use of newer 
  Socket.pm and drop the GetAddrInfo dependency entirely.
  ...Not technically "our problem" but this makes my life less annoying 
  on a couple machines :-)

  Some POD improvements and widely expanded tests.

  Drop 'tick' tracker for low-priority timer pool; pretty useless.

  Various small bug/oversight fixes:
   - Conf.pm; catch Serializer failures and report more details
     Related Plugin::Rehash fix to leave current configs untouched on
     read_cfg failures.
   - IRC.pm; more consistent error messages
   - IRC::Event::Nick; fix common() when channels() has changed
   - Explicitly 'use strictures' in IRC::* subclasses
   - Plugin::Auth; log to error() not emerg()

* 0.005  (29 May 2012)

  Fix an IRC.pm bug that would cause failures if an error event was 
  received for a context that never completed a connection.

  Fix Utils.pm bug in glob_* functions that would cause failures when
  operating on a negative value. Should've been defined() checks.

  POD and test improvements and clean-ups.

* 0.004  (27 May 2012)

  Fix IRC.pm bug that kept sessions hanging about when the bot was 
  terminated via an online command. (This fixes the busted '!die' 
  command from Plugin::Master).
  Also improve shutdown cleanups in Core.

  Code cleanups (no functionality change):
   - Bot::Cobalt::IRC
   - Bot::Cobalt::Utils
   - Significant POD cleanups

* 0.003  (22 May 2012)

  Require perl-5.12.1; given/when changed sometime in there, it seems,
   and I'm tired of playing with EOL Perls anyway.

  Some Plugin::RDB cleanups.

* 0.002

  Fix a couple oversights resulting in test failures:
   - Fix Utils.pm test failures on <perl-5.14
   - Fix Plugin::Auth syntax error on <perl-5.14

  Plugin::RDB:
   - Warn if Info3 seems to be missing

  POD tweaks.

* 0.001

  Initial release of Bot::Cobalt
