# Bot::Cobalt Changes

* 0.005

  Fix an IRC.pm bug that would cause failures if an error event was 
  received for a context that never completed a connection.

  Fix Utils.pm bug in glob_* functions that would cause failures when
  operating on a negative value. Should've been defined() checks.
  
  POD and test improvements and clean-ups.

* 0.004

  Fix IRC.pm bug that kept sessions hanging about when the bot was 
  terminated via an online command. (This fixes the busted '!die' 
  command from Plugin::Master).
  Also improve shutdown cleanups in Core.

  Code cleanups (no functionality change):
   - Bot::Cobalt::IRC
   - Bot::Cobalt::Utils
   - Significant POD cleanups

* 0.003

  Require perl-5.12.1; given/when changed sometime in there, it seems,
   and I'm tired of playing with EOL Perls anyway.

  Some Plugin::RDB cleanups.

* 0.002

  Fix a couple oversights resulting in test failures:
   - Fix Utils.pm test failures on <perl-5.14
   - Fix Plugin::Auth syntax error on <perl-5.14

  Plugin::RDB:
   - Warn if Info3 seems to be missing

  POD tweaks.

* 0.001

  Initial release of Bot::Cobalt
