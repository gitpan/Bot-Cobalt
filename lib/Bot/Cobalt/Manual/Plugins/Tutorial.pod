=head1 NAME

Bot::Cobalt::Manual::Plugins::Tutorial - Let's write a simple plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick-start plugin authoring guide.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Let's write a simple plugin that will respond to a command with a random 
string.

=head2 Outline

We'll at least need a package name, a version, some utilities, and an 
object constructor.

Declare our package:

  package My::Bot::Cobalt::Plugin;
  our $VERSION = '0.01';

We might need L<Bot::Cobalt::Common> utilities.
It's good practice to use strict and warnings explicitly, although 
L<Bot::Cobalt::Common> will import them for you. It's even better to 
make warnings fatal as well via L<strictures>:

  use strictures 1;
  use Bot::Cobalt::Common;

We probably also want the syntax sugar exported by L<Bot::Cobalt>. This 
provides a simpler function interface to common core methods; we'll be 
able to call C<broadcast()> to relay events and C<logger()> to log 
messages.

  use Bot::Cobalt;

(See L<Bot::Cobalt::Core::Sugar> for more on exported sugar.)

We can add a simple empty constructor:

  sub new { bless {}, shift }

=head2 Registering

Our plugin can't be loaded unless it can handle B<Cobalt_register> and 
B<Cobalt_unregister> events. It's also probably not very useful unless 
it's registered to receive some kind of event, most often from 
L<Bot::Cobalt::IRC>.

Let's register to receive the in-channel command 'fortune' -- we'll 
figure out some responses to it later. Since we 'use Bot::Cobalt' we 
have the C<register()> and C<logger()> functions available:

  sub Cobalt_register {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;

    register( $self, 'SERVER',
      ## A list of events to catch.
      qw/ 
        public_cmd_fortune
      /
    );
    
    ## It's polite to log that we're here now.
    logger->info("Loaded - $VERSION");
    
    return PLUGIN_EAT_NONE
  }
  
  sub Cobalt_unregister {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;
    
    logger->info("Unloaded");
    
    return PLUGIN_EAT_NONE
  }

Notice the B<PLUGIN_EAT_NONE>? Our event handlers should B<always> 
return a L<Object::Pluggable::Constants> constant indicating what 
to do with the event after the handler is complete. This is typically 
one of I<PLUGIN_EAT_NONE> or I<PLUGIN_EAT_ALL>, indicating whether to 
let the event continue on down the pipeline or be terminated, 
respectively.

=head2 Handling commands

Now we're loadable and will register to receive the 'SERVER' event 
B<public_cmd_fortune> -- we just need a handler for it.

The first argument after the C<$self> and C<$core> objects will be a 
reference to a L<Bot::Cobalt::IRC::Message::Public> object. We'll 
de-reference it and call some common methods to find out what we want to 
know.

  sub Bot_public_cmd_fortune {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;
    
    ## Get our (de-referenced) message object.
    my $msg = ${ $_[0] };

    ## Get our server context, source nickname, and channel.
    my $context  = $msg->context;
    my $src_nick = $msg->src_nick;
    my $channel  = $msg->channel;
    
    ## We'll write our response method fortune() later.
    my $fortune = $self->fortune;
    my $response_string = "$src_nick: $fortune";
    
    ## Relay our response string back to Bot::Cobalt::IRC
    broadcast( 'message', $context, $channel,
      $response_string
    );
  
    ## This one eats the event when it's complete.
    return PLUGIN_EAT_ALL
  }

=head2 Add some data

For convenience, we'll store our fortune cookies in the B<DATA> 
filehandle until we need them.

At the bottom of your plugin module:

  1;  ## Perl modules must return a true value
  __DATA__

  You are not dead yet. Watch for further reports.
  Don't look up.
  You look tired.
  Fine day for friends. Crappy day for you.

Add as many as you like, one per line. When we want to retrieve them, we 
just read B<DATA> like a normal file handle.

Let's write our B<fortune()> method to pull a random fortune from 
our retrieved B<DATA> -- this is nice and simple:

  sub fortune {
    my ($self) = @_;

    $self->{fortunes} = [ readline(DATA) ]
      unless defined $self->{fortunes};
    
    return $self->{fortunes}->[ rand( @{$self->{fortunes}} ) ]
  }

=head2 Finished product

  package My::Bot::Cobalt::Plugin;
  our $VERSION = '0.01';

  use strictures 1;
  use Bot::Cobalt::Common;
  
  use Bot::Cobalt;

  sub new { bless {}, shift }

  sub Cobalt_register {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;

    register( $self, 'SERVER',
      ## A list of events to catch.
      qw/ 
        public_cmd_fortune
      /
    );
    
    ## It's polite to log that we're here now.
    logger->info("Loaded - $VERSION");
    
    return PLUGIN_EAT_NONE
  }
  
  sub Cobalt_unregister {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;
    
    logger->info("Unloaded");
    
    return PLUGIN_EAT_NONE
  }

  sub Bot_public_cmd_fortune {
    my ($self, $core) = splice @_, 0, 2;
    
    ## Get our (de-referenced) message object.
    my $msg = ${ $_[0] };

    ## Get our server context, source nickname, and channel.
    my $context  = $msg->context;
    my $src_nick = $msg->src_nick;
    my $channel  = $msg->channel;
    
    my $fortune = $self->fortune;
    my $response_string = "$src_nick: $fortune";
    
    ## Relay our response string back to Bot::Cobalt::IRC
    broadcast( 'message', $context, $channel,
      $response_string
    );
  
    ## This one eats the event when it's complete.
    return PLUGIN_EAT_ALL
  }

  sub fortune {
    my ($self) = @_;

    $self->{fortunes} = [ readline(DATA) ]
      unless defined $self->{fortunes};
  
    return $self->{fortunes}->[ rand( @{$self->{fortunes}} ) ]
  }

  1;  ## Perl modules must return a true value
  __DATA__
  You are not dead yet. Watch for further reports.
  Don't look up.
  You look tired.
  Fine day for friends. Crappy day for you.
